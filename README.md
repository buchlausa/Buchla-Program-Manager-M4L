# Description
This is not a wholesale replacement for the Buchla Program Manager App. It does, however, allow a lot of the same functions and shares the database with the Preset Manager App. While the space allotted for a M4L device radically changes the interface, it does allow automation of parameters.

Due to speed limitations, it's best to limit the amount of automation data sent to the Program Manager Card.

Besides access to the parameters and patch bay, you can also perform special operations on the presets. For example, you can crossfade the slider settings between the current and previously selected presets. You can also add random variation expressed as a percentage amount of deviation of all the current slider values. You can randomize the sliders wholesale or on a per-section basis. There is also random patching in the patchbay. Click the random button to create a random connection. You can undo those patches too.

You can save patches you make to the Program Manager database, and they will appear in the Buchla Program Manager App the next time you open it.

Integrated with live, you can add automation for many of the parameters and randomizations, making for tight integration with your productions. 

Because this device is open source, it provides access to all the sysex strings that address the parameters and connections available in the Program Manager Card, so you can dream up your own weird ideas of how to control your Easel Command.
