# Max for Live Buchla Program Manager
A Max for Live device that interfaces with the Buchla Program Manager Card.

# Goals
This is not a wholesale replacement for the Buchla Program Manager App. It does, however, allow a lot of the same functions and shares the database with
the Preset Manager App. While the space alloted for a M4L device radically changes the interface, it does allow automation of parameters. 
Due to speed limitations, it's best to limit the amount of automation data sent to the Program Manager Card.

Besides access to the parameters and patch bay, you can also perform special operations on the presets. For example, you can crossfade the slider settings
between the current and previously selected presets. You can also add random variation expressed as a percentage amount of deviation of all the current slider
values. 

Because this device is open source, it provides access to all the sysex strings that address the parameters and connections available in the 
Program Manager Card, so you can dream up your own weird ideas of how to control your Easel Command.
